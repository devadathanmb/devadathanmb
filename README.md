## Hello there! 👋


- I’m **Devadathan**, a **software engineer** from **India**, mostly working on the **backend side of things**
- I find **Linux**, **backend systems**, and **cloud technologies** pretty interesting
- I enjoy **tinkering around** - **automating** random stuff, **reverse engineering APIs**, building things that make life easier, **self-hosting**, just to name a few
- I occasionally write about random things on my website [**devadathanmb.in**](https://devadathanmb.in) - anything from **life thoughts** to **computer science**
- No fancy skill badges here because I realized they're mostly trash and don't really mean much anyway

## Find me elsewhere 🌐
